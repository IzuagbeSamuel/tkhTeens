            <p><b>"For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the Lord, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Isreal."</b></p>
            <br>
            <li><b>(Acts 20:32)</b></li>
            <p><b>"And now, brethren, I command you to God, and to the Word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified."</b></p>

        <br>

        <li><h3>Preach/Teach the Gospel:</h3></li>
        <img src="images/preach.jpg" alt="">
        <p>As Christians it is our mission to preach or teach the Gospel to the unbelievers. Everywhere Jesus went he taught and preached God's precious Word. This responsibility sums up our whole mission as believers, preach to the unbelievers, disciple them, and send them to the harvest field is the mission for all believers.</p>

            <li><b>(Matthew 5:16):</b></li>
            <p>"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven"</p>
            <br>
            <li><b>(Matthew 28:18-20):</b></li>
            <p>And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br>

        <li><h3>Pray</h3></li>
        <img src="images/prayer.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Prayer is a way of relating: to God, to ourselves, to those around us. In opening our hearts and minds and souls to God we are challenged to grow, change, and to love. Just as we make time to spend with those we love, so in making time to pray we are seeking to grow in our relationship with the Divine. Prayer is the primary way for the believer in Jesus Christ to communicate his emotions and desires with God and to fellowship with God, it is direct address to God. It is the communication of the human soul with the Lord who created the soul. </p>
