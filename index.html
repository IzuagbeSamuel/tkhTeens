        <p>
          The Word of God is the beginning for a successful Christian life. As
          Christians we are commanded to meditate, hear, read, studying, and
          apply on it day and night. Studying the Word of God discloses our
          inheritance as believers, It gives us confidence to share the gospel,
          studying the Word of God is the only way to the revelation of God and
          his plans for man, the Word of God discipline the believers and help

          As Christians it is our mission to preach or teach the Gospel to the

          precious Word. This responsibility sums up our whole mission as
          believers, preach to the unbelievers, disciple them, and send them to
          the harvest field is the mission for all believers.

        <img src="images/prayer.jpg" alt="A man Praying" />
        <p>
          Prayer is a way of relating: to God, to ourselves, to those around us.
          In opening our hearts and minds and souls to God we are challenged to
          grow, change, and to love. Just as we make time to spend with those we
          love, so in making time to pray we are seeking to grow in our
          relationship with the Divine. Prayer is the primary way for the
          believer in Jesus Christ to communicate his emotions and desires with
          God and to fellowship with God, it is direct address to God. It is the
          communication of the human soul with the Lord who created the soul.

        <li><h3>LOVE</h3></li>
        <img src="images/love.jpg" alt="Friendship" />
        <p>
          Jesus made us know what love is. By laying down His life for us, He
          gave us and everlasting understanding of true love. Because of God's
          love for the world, we understand how love is and it is also
          undeserving and often unrequited. We occasionally love and care for
          ourselves, the bible did not really tell us to love ourselves, because
          it is not necessary. The point is that we all take care of ourselves,
          put ourselves, desires and ambitions first, before God and other
          people. As Christians we are to share and show love to God and other
          people around us and be selfless.

        <img src="images/worship.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>Worship is a way to express honor to God through devotion, admiration, and great respect. When we tend to be living a good life, we begin to take certain things for granted, such as having a safe place to lay our head, having enough food to eat. Counting those blessings make our lives better. As Christians, we are ought to always give thanks to the LORD for all he has provided. There are several ways on how we can worship God: 
          <ol>
            <li>Thank Him in Prayer</li>
            <li>Sing Praise</li>
            <li>Share Your Story</li>

        <li><h3>CONTROLLING THE TONGUE</h3></li>
        <img src="images/tongue.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The tongue is a small part of the body that boast of great things. It's considered as a little fire
          which can start up the burning of a forest. James talked about how little the tongue is but can
          cause a great disaster, James didn't really talk about how much words the tongue pour out but how
          strong our tongue to have the capacity to effect massive result. A man who has control over his
          tongue has massive control over his entire body. The point about the tongue being powerful doesn't really mean everything it does is positive.</p>
          <p>As Christians we are meant to always say the truth and keep our tongue from evil, to love the truth and always say the truth. Solomon said in the book of Proverbs vs 10 that as Christians we tend to sin when we talk too much, the point is that a wise man knows when to stop talking. It's better not to speak than to speak with regrets.  A good person brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and a bad person brings out bad things stored up in him but in the day of Judgement we are all going to give account to all the careless words we have spoken.
